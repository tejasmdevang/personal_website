Learnt asymptotic analysis, recurrences, classical numeric algorithms, and advanced data structures, covering topics crucial for algorithmic efficiency. Explored graph algorithms and computational strategies such as divide-and-conquer, greedy choice, and dynamic programming, gaining a diverse toolkit for problem-solving. Additionally, delved into the concept of NP-completeness, broadening my understanding of computational complexity in problem-solving.
