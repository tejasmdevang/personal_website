Developed a Java-based Android application inspired by Zomato, a popular online food ordering platform. The clone app utilized Firebase as the database, providing a robust and scalable backend infrastructure. Through Java programming, the application replicated key features of Zomato, allowing users to browse restaurants and place orders seamlessly. The Firebase integration facilitated real-time data synchronization, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience within the cloned mobile application.
